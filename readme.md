This app provides a shelter with pets for you to take care of.

The shelter consists of Organic cats and dogs, and robotic cats and dogs.

The dogs are kept in cages (the organic ones will soil theirs, unless you walk them.

The organic pets will get hungry, thirsty, and bored. Keep these numbers low to
keep their health and happiness levels high. They will also get sleepy but there's not
much we can do about that, they'll fall asleep on their own.

The organic cats will use a communal litterbox which you must keep clean to keep their
health levels high.

The robotic pets do not experience hunger, thirst, boredom, or sleepiness, but they do
get rusty! If they get too rusty their happiness and health will start to drop.

You'll be presented with 9 options:

1. Feed the organic pets - lowers hunger

2. Water the organic pets - lowers thirst

3. Play with a pet - lowers boredom, raises sleepiness and happiness

4. Walk the dogs - walk all dogs at the same time, lowers boredom, raises 
   sleepiness and happiness

5. Oil the robotic pets - oils all the robotic pets to keep them from getting rusty

6. Clean the dog cages - clean all the dog cages to keep them happy and healthy

7. Empty the communal litterbox - empty the litterbox to keep the cats healthy and happy

8. Do nothing.- time will still pass and your pets needs will rise

9. Quit the game.
